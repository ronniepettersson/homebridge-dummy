## Disclaimer

Any issues or damage resulting from use of this plugin are not the fault of the developer. Use at your own risk.

## v1.0 Migration

### tl;dr

‼️ There are significant code changes between v0.9 and v1.0 which means you will need to reconfigure HomeKit automations after upgrading. Homebridge Dummy will try to help migrate old accessories.

### Why?

The original HomebridgeDummy was written almost 10 years ago and uses the now deprecated [Accessory Plugin](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/api/accessory-plugins) architecture.

While this still works okay for now, migrating the code to use [Platform Plugins](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/api/platform-plugins) will future-proof Homebridge Dummy and allow for more modern and robust design patterns.

The architecture used in v1.0 will make it much easier to improve and extend this plugin going forward and already includes several new features.

### Drawbacks

Unfortunately, there is no built-in way to migrate existing accessory plugins to platform plugins. This means that all accessories will be considered "new" by HomeKit, so any existing automations or room setups will be lost.

However, Homebridge Dummy will try to help migrate the accessory configurations to the new system to prevent you having to set them all up again in Homebridge.

### HOOBS Users

Homebridge Dummy now requires `customUi` for the config UI to help with migration from older versions, translations, UUID generation and some other useful tools. Unfortunately, HOOBS does not support `customUi`.

If you use HOOBS your current options are:

1. Upgrade to v1.0+ and use Advanced Mode to manually edit the JSON config
2. Continue to use `v0.9.2` which should continue to work for the foreseeable future but won't include any of the new features
3. Migrate your system to Homebridge which is very actively developed and has an engaged community of developers

You may also add a comment on [this ticket](https://github.com/hoobs-org/sidecars/issues/13) to help encourage the HOOBS team to add a "sidecar" for Homebridge Dummy.

### Migration Flow

⚠️ Please make sure to restart both Homebridge Service AND Homebridge UI after upgrading to v1.0 or you will experience issues with Homebridge Dummy configuration.

Once you have installed v1.0, click on the icon to configure the Homebridge Dummy plugin in the Homebridge UI and it will walk you through the necessary questionnaire.

Alternatively, you can add the following to "platforms" in your config.json

```json
{
    "name": "Homebridge Dummy",
    "platform": "HomebridgeDummy",
    "migrationNeeded": true
}
```

You will need to restart Homebridge after completing the flow for changes to take effect.

⚠️ If you are using child bridges with v0.9, you may need to restart Homebridge _twice_ for migrated accessories to show up correctly.

You may safely ignore any "No plugin was found…" errors you see in the Homebridge logs. These should go away after a few Homebridge restarts.

### Problems?

This is an experimental flow and may not work as intended. If you see "Sorry, something went wrong with the accessory migration" or encounter other issues, please [create an issue](https://github.com/mpatfield/homebridge-dummy/issues/new?template=new-issue.md).

The first thing the flow does is create a backup called `config.json.bak` in your Homebridge directory. If all else fails, you can replace your `config.json` with the backup and downgrade to Homebridge Dummy v0.9 to restore your previous accessories.

## About

With this plugin, you can create any number of fake accessories which are useful for advanced automation with HomeKit scenes. Features include scheduling to trigger at a specific interval or times, resetting automatically after a delay, activating sensors such as motion or occupancy, running arbitrary commands such as cron, and more.

Currently, Doors, Garage Door Openers, Lightbulbs, Locks, Outlets, Switches, Thermostats, Windows, and Window Coverings are supported. If there is a particular device or feature you'd like to see, please [create an issue](https://github.com/mpatfield/homebridge-dummy/issues/new?template=new-issue.md).

- `defaultBrightness` — If set, lightbulb will have additional dimmer settings with this default brightness percentage
- `defaultLockState` - The initial value for the lock, "locked" or "unlocked"
- `defaultPosition` — Initial position for the door/garage/window/blinds, "open" or "closed"
- `defaultThermostatState` - The initial state for the thermostat, "auto", "heat", "cool", or "off"
- `defaultTemperature` - The default temperature for the thermostat in `temperatureUnits` defined above

### Options
- `enableWebook` - Turn on webhooks for this accessory. See [Webhooks](https://github.com/mpatfield/homebridge-dummy#webhooks) section below for details.
- `resetOnRestart` _ If true, accessory will return to default state when Homebridge restarts
- `disableLogging` — If true, state changes will not be logged

## Webhooks

You can optionally enable webhooks on an accessory by choosing `Enable Webhooks` in the config UI or setting `enableWebhooks` to `true` in the JSON config.

If at least one accessory has webhooks enabled, then Homebridge Dummy will start a webhook server on startup. The default port is `63743`, e.g. `http://localhost:63743/`. To change the port, add `webhookPort` to the top level Homebridge Dummy config (see above).

Incoming requests must be valid JSON and include the id of the accessory, the desired command, and the value to set.

For example, to turn a switch on the JSON request should look like this:

```json
{
    "id": "17a62a7b",
    "command": "On",
    "value": true
}
```

Here's how you would call it from the command line.

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:63743/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": "17a62a7b", "command": "On", "value": true}
```

The accessory `id` can be found in the plugin JSON config.

Here are the possible values for `command` and their respective valid `value`

- `Brightness` - number from 0-100
- `LockTargetState` - 0 (UNSECURED) or 1 (SECURED)
- `On` - true or false
- `TargetHeatingCoolingState` - 0 (OFF), 1 (HEAT), 2 (COOL), 3 (AUTO)
- `TargetPosition` - number from 0-100
- `TargetTemperature` - number between 10°C and 38°C

For `TargetTemperature` you may optionally supply a `unit` (either 'F' or 'C') to allow you to pass in Fahrenheit or Celsius units.

```json
{
    "id": "18a35b6c",
    "command": "TargetTemperature",
    "value": 72,
    "unit": "F"
}
```
